ConTeGe
=======

ConTeGe (short for Concurrent Test Generator) is a framework for generating sequential and concurrent unit tests. We is a research platform to build tools for finding correctness and performance problems in sequential and concurrent Java classes. In particular, ConTeGe is the basis for the following approaches:

 * An automatic and precise thread safety checker that found previously unknown bugs in the JDK
 
See [thread-safe.org](http://thread-safe.org) for details.

 * An approach for automatic substitutability testing that finds various bugs in widely used Java classes
