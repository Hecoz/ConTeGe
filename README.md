# SpeedGun: Performance Regression Testing for Concurrent Classes

This branch of ConTeGe contains the source code for SpeedGun, an approach for performance regression testing of concurrent classes. To experiment with SpeedGun and to compare to the approach as described in our [ISSTA 2014 paper](http://mp.binaervarianz.de/issta2014.pdf), please download on of the following packages:

 * [SpeedGun-1.0](https://github.com/michaelpradel/ConTeGe/releases/download/SpeedGun-1.0/SpeedGun-1.0.tar.gz) (**28 MB**): Includes the source code, **one benchmark**, and scripts to reproduce our results.
 * [SpeedGun-1.0_all_benchmarks-part1](https://github.com/michaelpradel/ConTeGe/releases/download/SpeedGun-1.0/SpeedGun-1.0_all_benchmarks-part1.tar.gz) and [part2](https://github.com/michaelpradel/ConTeGe/releases/download/SpeedGun-1.0/SpeedGun-1.0_all_benchmarks-part2.tar.gz) (**1.7 GB**): Includes the source code, **all benchmarks** that we use in our evaluation, and scripts to reproduce our results. After downloading both parts, merge them into a single directory.
